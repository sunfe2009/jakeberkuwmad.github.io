description: University Housing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison provides a home for over 7,400 undergraduate students. Each year, University Housing hires over 100 students as House Fellows. The role of a House Fellow is to support and foster an active academic community and uphold Housing policy. When this policy is violated, it is up to House Fellows to write incident reports, a previously error-prone and time-consuming process.

    <h2>Goals</h2>

  <div class="project-description">
    <div class="rule"></div>
    <p>University Housing expressed interest in fully digitizing the process of submitting Incident Reports (colloquially known as “documenting” an incident). The aim was to alleviate the demand the current process places on House Fellows and ensure more accurate reports, a benefit to those residents involved. A majority of incident reports are written for alcohol or drug violations, but also for situations like bias incidents, vandalism, excessive noise, and room lock-outs.</p>

    <div class="rule"></div>
    <p>The research extended over a long period of time so as to accommodate the varied experience levels of our user group, House Fellows. Studies conducted early in the research phase, with first-year House Fellows, highlighted gaps in the process of submitting Incident Reports. Newer House Fellows lacked the skills needed to handle this antiquated system. Later research, focused primarily on second- or third-year House Fellows provided insight into behavior. Additional research involved probes into the many digital forms that are filled out during the documentation process as well as the physical environment in which the situations occur.</p>

    <h2>Findings</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="project-description">
    <div class="rule"></div>
    <p>Looking at the distribution of time across the entire documentation process, an inordinate amount of time was spent recording, confirming, and entering involved resident’s identification information. Second to this portion is recording a clear, objective report on the incident. This is also the most consistently inaccurate portion of an Incident Report. </p>
