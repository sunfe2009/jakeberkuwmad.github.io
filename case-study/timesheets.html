title: Timesheets Redesign
description: At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Student Center is a widely used application. It is used to register for classes, fill out time sheets, and more. Despite it's essential utilities, the application's interface is notoriously egregious and fundamentally unusable. The challenge at hand was to reconsider the student's experience submitting their time sheets.

    <p>To identify the existing problems,  research began with a series of contextual inquiries.  These one-on-one interviews highlighted a few key take-aways. First, the context wherein submitting a timesheet occurs is crucial. Participants entering their hours at home, long after their shift, put in more effort and were often inaccurate. Participants overwhelmingly cited forgetfulness as the reason they didn't enter their hours at work. Additionally, an overload of information on each page caused breakdowns in each participant's process. The system lacks appropriate feedback, so tasks are often completed without confidence. Without feedback (confirmation), many participants failed to submit their time sheets for approval. A final round of contextual inquiries involved the managers for several of the initial participants. These interviews offered insight on relevant information after the submission of the time sheets.</p>

    <p>After completing the contextual inquiries, and compiling the data, a few initial solutions emerged. A punch in, punch out button offered a solution to many of the existing problems. It would simplify the process of adding time, provided much-needed feedback and increase accuracy. All ideas focused around leveraging a smarter system that could learn over time and predict a user's needs. One participant noted they entered the same times each week, as their schedule rarely changed. The solution would be to predict and offer suggestions as a user enters their time manually based on this history. The visual design and layout focused on legibility and organization. Excess input fields and information should be accessible, but not always visible.</p>
