title: Incident Reporting App
description: University Housing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison provides a home for over 7,400 undergraduate students. Each year, University Housing hires over 100 students as House Fellows. The role of a House Fellow is to support and foster an active academic community and uphold Housing policy. When this policy is violated, it is up to House Fellows to write incident reports. University Housing expressed interest in fully digitizing the process of submitting Incident Reports (colloquially known as “documenting” an incident). The aim was to alleviate the demand the current process places on House Fellows and ensure more accurate reports, a benefit to those residents involved.

    <p>Two cultural probes helped better understand the processes of responding to and documenting incidents. The first, a usability survey, focused on difficulty and time spent. This easily completed form was filled out any time an incident occurred. A stack of the paper forms was accessible to all House Fellows.</p>
