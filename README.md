# Jacob Berchem - Portfolio

I'm a visual and user experience designer from Wisconsin. This is my personal design portfolio.

##### Typography
The logo mark is set in [Underwood](http://jacobberchem.com/portfolio/underwood/), a typeface I initially designed in 2012.
The remaining type is set in Daalton Maag's [Aktiv Grotesk](https://www.daltonmaag.com/library/aktiv-grotesk_), hosted with [Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts/aktiv-grotesk-std).

##### Tools
In addition to Typekit for font hosting, I am also utilizing [Picturefill](https://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) for my responsive image solution. This site was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
